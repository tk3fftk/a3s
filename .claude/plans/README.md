# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for the a3s AWS resource browser TUI project.

## Overview

The a3s project is a k9s-style AWS resource browsing terminal user interface built with:

- **Ink v4**: React-based CLI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **AWS SDK v3**: Primary AWS integration
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework
- **Docker**: Containerization and LocalStack integration

## Plan Structure

Each phase represents a major milestone in the project development:

### Completed Phases

- **Phase 1**: Provider Architecture (`phase-1-provider-architecture.md`)

  - Abstract provider pattern
  - SDK and CLI provider implementations
  - Provider factory with auto-detection
  - Comprehensive test coverage

- **Phase 2**: UI Components (`phase-2-ui-components.md`)

  - Ink-based React components
  - Home screen with service selection
  - Resource list with table display
  - Status bar with backend/profile info

- **Phase 3**: Integration (`phase-3-integration.md`)
  - Directory structure unification
  - Docker containerization
  - LocalStack integration for development
  - Interactive navigation with quit functionality

### Future Phases

- **Phase 4**: Data Integration (`phase-4-data-integration.md`)

  - Real AWS data fetching and display
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Data refresh mechanisms

- **Phase 5**: Navigation Enhancement (`phase-5-navigation-enhancement.md`)

  - Arrow key navigation
  - Pagination for large datasets
  - Search and filtering

- **Phase 6**: Service Expansion (`phase-6-service-expansion.md`)
  - Additional AWS services (S3, Lambda, RDS)
  - Service-specific views and actions
  - Performance optimizations

## Usage

1. Read the relevant phase plan before implementing features
2. Follow the TDD approach outlined in each plan
3. Update plans if implementation deviates from the original design
4. Create new plans for significant feature additions

## Testing Strategy

All phases follow Test-Driven Development (TDD):

- Write failing tests first
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor while keeping tests green
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

Current test status: 59 passing tests across 8 test files.

## Quality Assurance

### Required Checkpoints

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Plan completion criteria met

### TDD Workflow

This project follows Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
