# Phase 3: Integration

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Duration**: Integration and Docker setup  
**Test Coverage**: 59 tests passing

## Overview

Unified the project structure, implemented Docker containerization with LocalStack integration, and added interactive navigation with quit functionality.

## Key Achievements

✅ **Directory Structure Unification**

- Moved all code from `source/` to `src/`
- Updated tsconfig.json configuration
- Fixed test imports and paths

✅ **Docker Integration**

- Multi-stage Dockerfile for a3s
- Docker Compose with LocalStack
- Health checks and service dependencies
- Development environment scripts

✅ **LocalStack Support**

- Environment variable configuration
- Endpoint URL support in providers
- Development credentials handling
- Container networking setup

✅ **Interactive Navigation**

- Global quit functionality with 'q' key
- Back navigation with arrow/escape keys
- Proper process termination
- Test environment safety

✅ **Build System**

- npm start script added
- Docker Compose scripts
- Linting and testing integration
- TypeScript compilation fixes

## Technical Implementation

### Docker Setup

```yaml
services:
  localstack:
    image: localstack/localstack:latest
    environment:
      - SERVICES=ec2,s3,lambda,rds
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'curl', '-f', 'http://localhost:4566/health']

  a3s:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      localstack:
        condition: service_healthy
```

### Environment Configuration

- AWS_ENDPOINT_URL for LocalStack
- A3S_BACKEND for provider selection
- AWS_PROFILE for credential management

### Navigation Enhancement

- Global keyboard event handling
- Consistent quit behavior
- Back navigation support
- Process termination with waitUntilExit()

## Lessons Learned

1. **Directory Structure**: Consistent structure prevents build issues
2. **Docker Networking**: Service dependencies crucial for startup order
3. **Environment Variables**: Flexible configuration enables multiple environments
4. **Testing**: Environment checks prevent useInput issues in tests
5. **Process Management**: Proper termination improves user experience
